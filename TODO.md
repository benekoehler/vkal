### TODOs

- [ ] Move duplicate image loading code from examples to /utils/*.c.
- [x] Make shaders compile automatically in Visual Studio.
      NOTE: Googles shaderc (https://github.com/google/shaderc) is used. In order create eg vs-files with cmake that
      already links to shaderc_combined cmake v3.24 is needed!
- [ ] Fix formatting of sourcecode.
- [ ] Correct description-comments in examples.
- [x] Use C-Library to load files instead of native OS-specific APIs.
- [x] Replace some of the (unlicensed) textures for example programs.
- [x] Create DearImGUI example.
- [ ] Define VKAL_TRUE / VKAL_FALSE instead of using uint32_t for true / false.
- [x] Free malloc'd memory.
- [x] Print info about available swapchain present modes and which one was selected.
- [ ] Should ```render_pass``` not also be called ```default_render_pass```?
- [ ] Rename vkal_update_descriptor_set_uniform. Everything is a buffer. The descriptor type has to be
      passed to the function anyway, which is redundant information in case of a uniform buffer (and confusing otherwise!).
- [ ] read_file: Better error message when file not found.
- [ ] vkal_end_command_buffer -> vkal_end_default_command_buffer
- [ ] descriptor set layout creation: * layout param should be in plural form.
- [ ] Function that can bind multiple descriptor sets at once? Or just use original vk* command for this?
- [x] Fix VKAL_ASSERT macro: Does not fire when in Release-Build as it uses Libc's assert(). This is a problem
      when wrapping a Vulkan or VKAL call inside VKAL_ASSERT as it won't evaluate the function and
      lead to potentially uninitialized data!
- [ ] Examples: Create a proper Vulkan projection matrix so that flipping y in shader is
      not necessary.
- [ ] Better Info about what GPUs are available and if they support the requested features.
- [ ] Let the User enable/disable features if available.
- [ ] Is there a way to check if a GPU has the appropriate drivers installed, before vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR fails?!
- [x] Change VKAL struct for Buffers from Buffer -> VkalBuffer.
- [ ] Fix permission denied error for Git submodule SDL when adding vkal itself as a submodule to another repo.
- [ ] Use vkal_aligned_size whenever needing the aligned size of a value.
- [ ] map_memory: Maybe just give it the VkalBuffer object as it contains its size and offset into the device memory already?
      This would be far more convenient! See other instances where this function is being used.
- [ ] map_memory: If called multiple times with the same device-memory object, this call will fail (as memory is already mapped into host)!
      Make sure, multiple calles are possible. Maybe check how Khronos samples are doing it.
- [ ] Better error message when updating a descriptor at a binding point that doesn't exist in the shader or is
      occupied by another descriptor-type.
